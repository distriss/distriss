<h1 align="center">Hi 👋😊, I'm Triss</h1>
<p>
Hello there! I'm a Software Developer with an unending passion for coding. My journey into tech started over 15 years ago when I began creating online spaces for friends. 
  
After a transformative gap year, I delved into freelancing, building websites, CMS solutions, and products with third-party APIs. I’ve also developed various full-stack personal projects.

Knitter-Notes, my web app masterpiece, was born out of a deep love for knitting.
As a dedicated knitter, I aimed to create a digital haven for fellow enthusiasts, simplifying and
enhancing their knitting experience. This project reflects my commitment to merging technology
with personal passions and making a meaningful impact in a niche community.

I honed my skills at 100Devs, working on greenfield projects, optimizing large-scale applications, and mentoring newcomers. I'm also part of a CPACC study group, dedicated to upholding tech accessibility standards.

Beyond coding, I enjoy knitting, gaming, and sketch art. I believe technology has the power to create a positive impact and benefit everyone and look forward to contributing to exciting projects. Let's connect!
