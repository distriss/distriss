<h1 align="center">Hi 👋😁, I'm Triss</h1>
<h3 align="center">
My journey into tech began over 15 years ago when I discovered my passion for coding and creating online spaces for friends.

During a transformative gap year, I struck a balance that allowed me to deepen my involvement in the tech field. Eventually started freelancing building websites, CMS and products incorporating third-party APIs among other things. As well as developing a handful of full-stack personal projects.

I joined 100Devs as a Software Developer and sharpened my skills in creating reliable and scalable software. I got to work on greenfield projects and optimised large-scale applications as well as supporting and mentoring entry-level developers.
During this time, I honed my coding skills and developed a user-friendly educational web app, that connects teachers, students, and parents.

I'm also an active member of a CPACC study group and committed to upholding Accessibility standards in tech.

Now, I'm eager to bring my expertise to a product team, where I can actively contribute to product development and its long-lasting impact.
